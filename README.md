These are papers implemented from scratch to obtain a better understanding of how Neural Networks work. 
The current, and also slightly ambitious list, in no specific order for implementing papers are: 

1. Resnet
2. Batch/Layer Normalization
3. Transformer Architecture
4. ViT
5. LoRa
6. GAN
7. DCGAN
8. U-Net
9. DDPM
10. Latent Diffusion Models
11. Stable Diffusion Models
